These are the methods used to access the database. Every file makes use of the DB.php found in server/app. There lies the connection string to database. The methods are used to access the database and return the results to the files that called them.
There are a lot of methods used to access the database, and they are grouped on the same category as the controllers and services.
Only the services should be allowed to call these methods.


The repositories found in the actual version of the server are:
- AdminRepository - used to access the database for admin related queries
- BookRepository - used to access the database for book related queries, such as getting all books, getting a book by id, searching for a book, getting all the books from above an id
- QuestionRepository - used to access the database for question related queries, such as getting all questions, getting a question by id
- RepliesRepository - used to access the database for replies related queries such as getting the replies for a question by providing the question id
- ReviewsRepository - used to access the database for reviews related queries, such as getting all reviews, getting a review by id, getting all the reviews for a book by providing the book id or to provide all the reviews coming from one user by providing the user id
- RssRepository - used to access the database for rss related queries, such as getting the last seen ids for books and reviews for a specific user by providing the user id
- userRepository - used to perform the crud operations over the user model


When starting to define a repository it is always better to think of the inserting/retrieving models and to define them in app/models.
The actual models are the following:
- /auth: LoginModel, RegisterModel, UserModel
- BookModel
- QuestionModel
- ReplyModel
- ReviewModel

They either describe an actual model from the database or group the data coming from front-end such as LoginModel/RegisterModel
