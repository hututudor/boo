The first components of the server after the Router are the controllers. They group the methods responding to some specific endpoints.
Each method from a controller should map an endpoint and should respond to the Request. The Request is a class that contains all the information about the request, such as the headers, the body, the query parameters, etc. The Request is passed to the method as a parameter. The method should return a Response. The Response is a class that contains all the information about the response, such as the headers, the body, the status code, etc. The Response is returned by the method.
If necessary the methods should check if the user is logged in by checking the bearer coming with the request. If the user is not logged in, the method should return a 401 status code. If the user is logged in, the method should continue with the execution by calling the service layer.
Any response can be decorated with any header.
