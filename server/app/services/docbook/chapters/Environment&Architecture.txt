The architecture of this application lies on 3 layers:
- Controllers
- Services
- Repositories


The environment of this application is provided by Xampp.The server is Apache and the database is MySQL/MariaDB.
Currently in use is the 10.4.24-MariaDB version and PHP 8.1.0 version.
The database is structured on 5 tables:
- users
- books
- reviews
- questions
- replies


These tables are used to provide the basic CRUD operations for the application.
Two more tables are used to provide the functionalities for setting a status for a book and the rss feed:
- user_books
- rss_feed


The application makes the routing by providing only one page: index.php.
To this page are sent all the requests and the routing is made by the server.

To provide the route for the request the application needs a get parameter to index.php called "route" with the value starting with a slash. The '/number' is extracted, and it is recommended to be used as an id.
The route is split by the slashes and the numbers found are extracted.
After providing a route, the first '?' is considered to be the started of the get parameters of that route.

For example:
http://localhost/boo/server/public/index.php?route=/api/books/2/readingStatus

This is a valid URL of the application.
- The DEFAULT_ROUTE where lies the server is http://localhost/boo/server
- the page that responds to each call is at http://localhost/boo/server/public/index.php
- the route is /api/books/2/readingStatus
- the id of the book is 2

    If desired to put some get parameters use
    http://localhost/boo/server/public/index.php?route=/api/books/2/readingStatus?param1=value1&param2=value2
        - the parameters are added after the second '?' of the URL
        - the parameters are separated by '&'
        - the parameters are:
            - param1 with value value1
            - param2 with value value2

In order to create a new endpoint, the following steps are required:
- create a new controller in the Controllers folder
- create a new service in the Services folder
- create a new repository in the Repositories folder if necessary
- add the new route in the routes/index.php file
